Can we, we keep
Keep each other company?
Oh, maybe we can be
Be each other's company
Oh, company

Let's set each other's lonely nights
Be each other's paradise
Need a picture for my frame
Someone to share my reign
Tell me what you wanna drink
I tell you what I got in mind
Oh, I don't know your name
But I feel like that's gonna change


You ain't gotta be my lover
For you to call me baby
Never been about no pressure
Ain't that serious

Can we, we keep
Keep each other company?
Oh, maybe we can be
Be each other's company
Oh, company

It ain't about the complications
I'm all about the elevation
We can keep it going up
Oh, don't miss out on us
Just wanna have a conversation
Forget about the obligations
Maybe we can stay in touch
Oh, that ain't doing too much

You ain't gotta be my lover
For me to call you baby
Never been about no pressure
Ain't that serious, no
